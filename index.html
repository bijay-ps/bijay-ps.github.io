				<p>Hi there, I am a goal oriented working professional currently located in Bangalore. I have overall 4+ years of industry experience with 3 years of experience in frontend development. I crave towards perfection. I am always looking to imporve my skill set and keep challenging myself. My near future goal is to become a MEAN stack developer. Am an ambivert with little more inclination towards being introvert. I love travelling and reading a lot, wether it may be a fiction novel or some self-help book, doesn't matter. Few of my friends even call me a voracious reader. Well, that's me!! :) :)</p>
